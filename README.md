# Horiseon Code Refactor #
This was a code refactoring project for Horiseon Media's website. This project was necessary in order to condense and simplify the HTML and CSS documents so as to increase the readability of said documents. This was done by shifting many of the elements with identical CSS properties into singular classes. I also added alt tags to every photo or image in the HTML document to assist those that are visually impaired. In order to write clear and concise image descriptions, I used an article that I've listed below in [Resources](#resources). In addition, a few minor features were not functioning properly, so those were amended. For further tweaks and changes, please read the comments I have made in the HTML and CSS documents.

Thank you to [Perkin's eLearning](https://www.perkinselearning.org/technology/blog/how-write-alt-text-and-image-descriptions-visually-impaired) for helping me write better image descriptions.
